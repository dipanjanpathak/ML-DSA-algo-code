# Machine Learning Algorithms & Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from Scratch

Welcome to the **ML & DSA from Scratch** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to implementing machine learning algorithms and fundamental data structures & algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to enhance understanding by building everything from the ground up without relying on pre-built libraries like Scikit-Learn.


## ✨ Features
- Implementing **machine learning algorithms** from scratch to understand their inner workings.
- Writing fundamental **data structures and algorithms** in Python to strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Well-structured and documented code for easy understanding.
- No external ML libraries like Scikit-Learn—just **NumPy and Pandas (for handling data)**.

## 🔥 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipanjanpathak/ML-DSA-algo-code.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   ML-DSA-algo-code
   ```


## 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
